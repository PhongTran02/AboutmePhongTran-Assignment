<h3>Ambitions and Dreams:</h3>
<p>I'm going to describe myself as a color. As you might know that each color has its own meaning inside, so yellow represents how I am right now, which is happiness, hope, optimism. Therefore, I’m a person who love to achieve happiness in life. To do that, I want to do something that is meaningful and contribute great things to the society. In particular, drawing is one of my abilities and also a gift to me, so my biggest dream is to be a well-known illustrator and keep creating masterpieces of arts to impress the viewers. After have a balanced finance, I love to have a partner who will be happily together with me as a family. That is how happiness definition is in my perspective.</p>
