    <h1>Drawing</h1>
    <p>Drawing is one of the best ability given from my father. He is a person who work in an entertainment industry, therefore I'm a person who also love art and want to draw. That is why I want to go to JU and learn graphic design t furthermore open my mind for other thing. However, my main career that I want to follow is making illustrations</p>

<div class="Dancing">
    <h1>Dancing</h1>
    <p>Dancing is usually what I want to move my body through a melody. I want to feel myself as I'm flowing, floating, flying into the music and move unconsiously with it. I have joined some of the event for dancing just to make good memory. </p>

<div class="Sports">
    <h1>Sports</h1>
    <p>As you might know that I love to move my body, but no mean that I like to run due to the fact that I have a weak condition. Therefore, there are two sports that I want to play the most: The main one is Volleyball, next one is Badminton. I want to play Volleyball because It is really fun and I don't waste so much energy into it. Moreover I can improve my height with jumping and strengths.</p>
